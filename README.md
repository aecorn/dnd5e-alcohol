# dnd5e-alcohol

> DISCLAIMER (shortened):
> dnd5e-alcohol is a fantasy roleplaying module for FoundryVTT and does not promote or encourage real-life alcohol consumption. This is purely fictional and should not be interpreted as endorsing drinking, especially underage drinking or alcohol use during pregnancy. I seek no financial gain from this module. Please play and drink responsibly, and remember that real-world alcohol consumption carries risks. (See full disclaimer at bottom of Readme.)

Inspired by this [ruleset by CupidFaust on GMBinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M0rTarrzYJgR5jiH0j6#:~:text=Once%20your%20Alcohol%20Level%20is%20equal%20to%20one%20half%20of,Wisdom%20checks%20and%20saving%20throws)
Many changes have been made to better fit the base dnd5e system in FoundryVTT.


If you have ideas for enhancements or errors to report, use the "issues" on this repo.

# Todo:
- make sure poisoned condition is added along Wasted



## Inebriation "points"
The characters now have a numeric flag of how many "inebriation points" they have. Consuming alcohol will prompt for a Save, if the save is failed, the potency of the drink is applied to the character.

### Inebriation meter in character sheet
![Inebriation bar](imgs/inebriation_bar.png) \
There is a bar / meter in the character sheet that shows the current inebriation points.

### Thresholds for new conditions
![Conditions token](imgs/conditions_token.png) \
When the inebriation points reach certain thresholds (decided by your constitution score), you will get increasing worse alcohol-induced conditions. Tipsy > Drunk > Wasted > Incapacitated.

#### Tipsy
- +2 to persuasion
- -2 to insight
- -2 to wisdom saves

### Drunk
- -2 to all attacks
- -2 to int and wisdom checks and saves

### Wasted
- Poisoned condition
- May vomit uncontrollably
- May fail regaining hp, hit dice and spell slots on first long rest


## 3 Macros for the DM
![Macros](imgs/macros.png) \
By selecting tokens, the GM can manipulate the inebriation points with these 3 macros.

## Rest
Taking a short rest will reduce the inebriation points on a character by 1.
Taking a long rest will reduce inebriation to 0, but going to bed with the Wasted condition might ruin your sleep, and hinder you from regaining spell slots, hp and hit dice (constitution save).
