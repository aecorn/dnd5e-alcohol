      <p>Weapon (quarterstaff), rare (requires attunement)</p><p>Wherever there
      is a man who drinks too much too consistently, there is one of these
      leaned against his table. The wood is soaked in stale drink from years ago
      and a little wet to the touch.</p><p>While you have the tipsy condition,
      your speed increases by 5 feet. It increases again when you have the drunk
      condition and again when you have the wasted condition. Your alcohol level
      does not inflict a penalty to attacks with this weapon.</p>
