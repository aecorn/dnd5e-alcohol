      <p>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</p><p>These gloves are made
      of brass that used to be part of a pair of tankards that wrap around the
      knuckles of the wearer, as well as the hanging cloth from tavern
      advertisements from days gone. Although useful in any fight, they're
      particularly nasty in the bar fights that broke the tankards and ripped
      the banners that they were made from.</p><p>While fighting without holding
      a conventional weapon and you have the drunk condition, your unarmed
      strikes do 1d6 bludgeoning damage unless they would otherwise deal more.
      Additionally, improvised weapons deal 1d8 damage.</p>
